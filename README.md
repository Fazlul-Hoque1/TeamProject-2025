Web application to manage events

Title: Web application to manage events

GitHub: https://github.com/Fazlul-Hoque1/TeamProject-2025

Description: 
This web application allows users to easily create, browse, and join various events within a community or organization. Registered users can create new events by providing details such as the event name, description, date, location, and category. Other users can view these events, express interest, and join them. The platform also includes a social interaction feature where users can engage by commenting on event posts, sharing updates, and discussing event details. 
The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly platform that simplifies event organization, participation, and engagement in a digital community setting.
There will also be an admin section which allows admins to monitor everything and make changes as needed.
